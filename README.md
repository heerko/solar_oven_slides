# Solarpunks - Hardware setup slides

## [View the slides here](https://heerko.github.io/solar_oven_slides/html_output/index.html)

----

The slides are generated from a .rst by [Hovercraft](https://github.com/regebro/hovercraft).
- [Docs](https://hovercraft.readthedocs.io/en/latest/presentations.html#)
- [RST cheatsheet](https://github.com/ralsina/rst-cheatsheet/blob/master/rst-cheatsheet.rst)

I'm using [Devd](https://github.com/cortesi/devd) and [Modd](https://github.com/cortesi/modd) for serving and live reloading the slides locally. 

Start it all up by running: 
```
modd
```
And view the slides in your browser at: http://devd.io:8000/

Or to compile it just once:
```
make html
```
